## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Page structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Scroll effect logic  

---

## ⚡ How It Works
1. The background image starts with high opacity and zoomed in.  
2. As you **scroll down**, JavaScript updates:
   - `opacity` → decreases gradually  
   - `background-size` → shrinks smoothly  
3. This creates a **fade & zoom effect** that enhances scrolling.
