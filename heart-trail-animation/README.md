## ✨ Features
- 🎨 Colorful heart trail effect
- 🖱️ Interactive with mouse movement
- ⏱️ Hearts disappear smoothly after a few seconds
- ⚡ Simple & lightweight (pure HTML, CSS, JS)

---

##  🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (using keyframes for animation)  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** (handling DOM interactions and events)

---

##  💡 How It Works
- 1. As you move your mouse, a new heart (`span`) element is created at your cursor position.  
- 2. Each heart gets a random size and its animation begins—drifting upward, fading out, and rotating through colors.  
- 3. After a short delay, each heart is automatically removed from the DOM.
