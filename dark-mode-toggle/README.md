# 🌙 Dark Mode Toggle  

A simple **Dark Mode Toggle Switch** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project allows users to switch between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** with a smooth animation.  
The selected mode is saved in **localStorage**, so the preference remains even after reloading or revisiting the page.

## ⚡ How It Works
1. The toggle switch is implemented using a **checkbox input**.  
2. When checked, the background changes to **Dark Mode**; otherwise, it stays in **Light Mode**.  
3. The state is stored in **localStorage** to keep the mode consistent across page reloads.
